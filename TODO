      constants.
    - Extend checker to simplify?  Eg ranges.  C field names.
    - Restrict vararrays in unions to only use fields declared outside
      or in same case.

  - Features
    - Add extra structure data fields and corresponding "clear" functions to
      output.
    - Write a thing to output nail grammars?
    - Propagate union tag restrictions to be constraints on tag field.
    - Use maxima for length fields to determine real max for vararray len

  - Code quality:
    - Simplify huge union case statements.
