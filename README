a trunnel is a primitive nail
=============================

The grammar is in GRAMMAR.

A mostly-readable example is in doc/example2.trunnel.

To see what it compiles into, run 

      python lib/CodeGen.py doc/example2.trunnel

That will create doc/example2.c and doc/example2.h


Better documentation to follow, I hope.
