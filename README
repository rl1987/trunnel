a trunnel is a primitive nail
=============================

The grammar is in doc/GRAMMAR.

A mostly-readable example is in examples/example2.trunnel.

There's some markdown-formatted documentation in doc/trunnel.md.

To see what it compiles into, run

      python -m trunnel.Main examples/example2.trunnel

That will create examples/example2.c and examples/example2.h .


If you want a tool that can handle sub-byte fields, backtracking,
complicated grammars, plugins, and fancy allocators, with a nice
principled design, don't use trunnel.  Have a look at 'nail' instead:
