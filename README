a trunnel is a primitive nail
=============================

The grammar is in doc/GRAMMAR.

A mostly-readable example is in doc/example2.trunnel.

To see what it compiles into, run

      python lib/CodeGen.py doc/example2.trunnel

That will create doc/example2.c and doc/example2.h .

Better documentation to follow, I hope.


If you want a tool that can handle sub-byte fields, backtracking,
complicated grammars, plugins, and fancy allocators, with a nice
principled design, don't use trunnel.  Have a look at 'nail' instead:
